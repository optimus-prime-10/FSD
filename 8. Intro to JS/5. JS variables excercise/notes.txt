JavaScript Variables Exercise: Swapping Values Challenge

Objective
Swap the values of two variables: variable 'a' (initially 3) and variable 'b' (initially 8). 
After swapping, 'a' should equal 8 and 'b' should equal 3.

Task
Write code on lines 7, 8, and 9 to exchange the variable values.

Rules and Constraints
- Cannot modify existing code outside designated lines
- Cannot type numbers directly (no 'a = 8' or 'b = 3')
- Cannot redeclare variables or change their types
- Must use variable manipulation only

The Bucket Analogy
Think of variables as buckets: bucket 'a' has sand, bucket 'b' has water. 
You need to exchange their contents so 'a' has water and 'b' has sand.

Solution Process
1. Use the interactive code playground to test your solution
2. Run code to verify the swap worked correctly
3. Click "Check Solution" to verify correctness
4. Review the solution walkthrough after completion

Learning Objectives
- Understanding variable value swapping
- Working within programming constraints
- Developing logical problem-solving skills
- Learning to avoid hard-coded values
