String Length Property

JavaScript strings have a `length` property that returns the number of characters.

Basic Usage:
```javascript
var name = "Somebody";
console.log(name.length); // Output: 8
```

Character Counter Example:

Create a simple character counter for tweets:

```javascript
var tweet = prompt("Compose your tweet:");
var remaining = 140 - tweet.length;
alert("You have written " + tweet.length + " characters, " + remaining + " remaining.");
```

Comments in JavaScript:
```javascript
// Single-line comment
/* Multi-line
   comment */
```

Important Notes:
- Accessing `.length` on null values will cause an error
- You can use `tweet.length` directly instead of storing in a variable
- The length property counts all characters including spaces

Key Takeaway: Use `.length` to get the character count of any string for validation, limits, or display purposes.
