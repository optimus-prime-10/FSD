# Introduction to JavaScript

## Origins and History
JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich in just 10 days in 1995 for Netscape Navigator, 
which dominated the 90s browser market with 80% market share. Originally called "Livescript," 
it was renamed JavaScript to capitalize on Java's popularity (despite having no relation to Java).

## The Problem It Solved
Before JavaScript, websites were static. Any interactive functionality required sending 
requests to servers and receiving new web pages, creating a slow user experience. 
JavaScript enabled dynamic behavior to run directly in browsers.

## What is "Script"?
JavaScript is a scripting language that controls web page elements, like how a theater script 
directs actors. For example:
- Script tells an h1 element to appear
- After 1 second, show a paragraph
- Change text content dynamically

## JavaScript vs Java
Despite the similar names, JavaScript and Java are completely different:
- **JavaScript**: Interpreted language that runs in browsers
- **Java**: Compiled language for applications
- They have "about as much in common as car and carpet"

## Modern Importance
JavaScript is now essential for the modern web:
- Supported by all major browsers
- Most popular programming language (2018 RedMonk survey)
- Powers everything from simple animations to complex web applications
- Sites like YouTube, Netflix, and Twitter require JavaScript to function

## Key Naming Facts
- **Livescript** → **JavaScript** → standardized as **ECMAScript**
- ES6, ES7, etc. refer to ECMAScript versions
- Microsoft created "JScript" as their version

## When to Learn JavaScript
Choose JavaScript if you want to build:
- Websites and web applications
- Interactive user interfaces
- Modern web experiences

JavaScript evolved from a simple 10-day solution into the language that powers the entire web.
