String Concatenation Summary

What is String Concatenation?
Concatenation joins strings together using the plus (+) operator. 
Only content inside quotation marks is combined.

Example: "hello" + " " + "world" = "hello world"

Key Points:
• Use + to combine strings
• Spaces must be explicitly included: "hello" + " " + "world"
• Variables can be concatenated: message + " " + name
• Only quoted content is joined together

Practice Challenge:
Create variables: message = "Hello" and name = your name
Write: alert(message + " " + name)

Important: Always include spaces between words as separate strings 
or within existing strings.
