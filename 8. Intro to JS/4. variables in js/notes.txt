JavaScript Variables

What are Variables?
Variables are containers that store data in computer memory. 
Think of them as labeled boxes that hold information you want 
to remember and use later.

Creating Variables
Use the `var` keyword to create a variable:

var myName = "Somebody";

Syntax: var variableName = value;

Getting User Input
Use `prompt()` to get input from users:

var yourName = prompt("What is your name?");

Displaying Values
Use `alert()` to show variable values:

alert(myName);

Updating Variables
Change values without using `var` again:

myName = "Jack";

Combining Variables
Use the + operator to combine variables with text:

alert("Hello " + yourName + ", welcome!");

Practical Example
Track changing data like game levels:

var gameLevel = 1;
gameLevel = 2;
alert("Level: " + gameLevel);
