# Color Theory Summary

## Introduction

Color theory is the strategic science of selecting colors that work 
harmoniously and communicate the right message to your audience. 
Poor color choices create confusion and unprofessional designs, 
while thoughtful combinations enhance effectiveness and user experience.

## Color Psychology

- **Red**: Energy, love, intensity - drives action and engagement
- **Yellow**: Joy, intellect, attention-grabbing - great for CTAs but avoid for backgrounds
- **Green**: Freshness, growth, safety - used by food/grocery companies
- **Blue**: Stability, trust, serenity - preferred by financial institutions
- **Purple**: Royalty, wealth, femininity - appeals to specific demographics

## Color Combination Methods

Choose 2-3 colors strategically based on your message, not personal preference.

### Analogous Colors
- Adjacent colors on the wheel
- Creates harmony
- Best for: navigation, backgrounds, logos

### Complementary Colors
- Opposite colors on the wheel
- Creates strong contrast
- Best for: logos, icons, standout elements
- **Avoid**: text/background combinations (causes eye strain)

### Other Methods
- **Triadic**: Three evenly spaced colors (balanced)
- **Square**: Four evenly spaced colors (diverse)
