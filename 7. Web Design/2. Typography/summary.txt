# Typography Guide

## Why Typography Matters
Font choice significantly impacts mood and perception. The right typography makes designs look professional and effectively communicates your message.

## Font Families

### Serif Fonts
- **Features:** Have small "feet" (serifs) at letter ends
- **Mood:** Serious, authoritative, traditional, stable
- **Use cases:** Legal documents, magazines, formal content
- **Sub-types:** Old Style (vintage), Transitional, Modern (e.g., Didot), Slab-Serif

### Sans-Serif Fonts  
- **Features:** Clean lines without serifs
- **Mood:** Friendly, modern, approachable, simple
- **Use cases:** Websites, body text, startup brands
- **Best for readability:** Humanist sub-family (Gill Sans, Tahoma, Verdana)

## Font Legibility Research
MIT study showed Humanist fonts reduce reading time by 30-40% compared to Grotesque sans-serif. Better readability = better user engagement.

### Legibility Checklist:
- Open letter shapes
- Ample letter spacing  
- Clear distinction between similar characters (g vs 9, O vs 0)
- Varying letter proportions

## Best Practices

### The Two-Font Rule
Limit designs to **maximum 2 fonts** for cleaner, professional appearance.

### Effective Font Pairing:
1. Choose fonts with similar moods and time periods
2. Create contrast: serif headers + sans-serif body (or vice versa)
3. Vary weights: bold headers + regular body text

## Key Takeaways
1. Typography influences design mood and professionalism
2. Serif = traditional/authoritative, Sans-serif = modern/friendly
3. Prioritize readability, especially for body text
4. Stick to 2 fonts maximum per design
5. Combine fonts with similar moods but contrasting characteristics
