CSS Float Summary

- The `float` property positions elements (often images) to the left or right, allowing text to wrap around them.
- Use the `clear` property (`clear: left`, `clear: right`, or `clear: both`) to prevent elements from wrapping around floated items.
- Floated elements are removed from the normal document flow, which can affect the layout of following elements.
- Float was historically used for layouts, but modern CSS recommends Flexbox and Grid for this purpose.
- Today, float is mainly used for wrapping text around images.

Teaching Method
