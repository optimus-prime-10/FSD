CSS Positioning – Quick Summary

- Static: Default; elements follow normal flow; can’t use top/left/right/bottom.
- Relative: Moves element from its normal spot; uses top/left/right/bottom; other elements stay put.
- Absolute: Positions relative to nearest positioned ancestor (else page); removed from flow.
- Fixed: Positions relative to viewport; stays put on scroll; removed from flow.

z-index: Controls stacking order (higher = on top); works with positioned elements.

Key Properties: top, left, right, bottom (offsets element as per positioning type).

Common Uses:
- Relative + absolute for overlays/tooltips.
- Fixed for sticky navbars, floating buttons.

Best Practices:
- Use relative on parent for absolute children.
- Don’t overuse absolute/fixed/z-index.
- Test for responsiveness.

Pitfalls:
- Forgetting parent’s relative for absolute children.
- Overusing z-index.
- Not realizing absolute/fixed removes from flow.
