Web Design Agency Website Project Summary

Overview:
- Build a beautiful, simple, and responsive website for a Creative Design Agency (dev.com).
- The site features two blocks of text describing the agency's work and a footer with the motto: "Create, Develop Design."
- Focus on clean design and responsiveness: On large screens, content is side-by-side; on small screens (e.g., iPhone), blocks stack vertically and center for better usability.

Key Concepts & Guidelines:
- Practice CSS layout: display, float, block, inline-block, and responsiveness.
- Start with the provided index.html, preview in browser, and compare with solution.html.
- Solution example: image with text floating beside it, two sections, responsive stacking at ~600px width.
- You may design your own layout or replicate the solution. Ensure your design is visually appealing and responsive.
- After finishing, compare your code with the solution to learn different layout techniques.

Solution Highlights & Examples:
- The solution uses a <span class="creative"> to style part of the text differently (example of inline element styling).
- Media query at 680px and below: content blocks stack vertically, width set to 100%, text justified for clean lines.
- CSS floats (float-left, float-right) align cards left and right for flexible layouts.
- Uses object-fit to control image resizing within containers (see MDN Docs for details).

Tips:
- Research unfamiliar CSS properties (like object-fit) for deeper understanding.
- Try your own design before checking the solution for maximum learning.
- Share your unique designs in the Q&A section if desired.

Key Takeaways:
- Created a clean, responsive agency website layout.
- Used CSS display, float, and media queries for responsiveness.
- Styled inline elements with classes for emphasis.
- Applied media queries to stack content on small screens.

## Teaching Method
- Use a project-based approach to reinforce CSS layout and design concepts.
- Assign students to build and style a website from scratch.
- Encourage peer review and code comparison for learning different techniques.
- Discuss the importance of visual hierarchy and responsive design.
