Media queries are a core technique for responsive web design, allowing you to apply different CSS styles based on device characteristics, most commonly screen width. By using the @media rule with breakpoints (like max-width or min-width), you can change layouts, font sizes, or colors for various devices such as mobiles, tablets, laptops, and desktops. 

Example:
@media (max-width: 600px) {
  h1 {
    font-size: 1.2em;
  }
}
This changes the h1 font size for screens 600px wide or less (e.g., mobile phones).

You can combine min-width and max-width to target specific ranges:
@media (min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 900px) {
  div {
    width: 300px;
  }
}
This applies styles only for screens between 600px and 900px wide.

Device breakpoint examples:
- Mobile devices: 319px to 480px
- iPads and tablets: 481px to 1200px
- Laptops: 1201px to 1600px
- Desktops: 1601px and above

A typical exercise is to change the background color for different device widths using media queries:
@media (max-width: 480px) { body { background: salmon; } }
@media (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 1200px) { body { background: powderblue; } }
@media (min-width: 1201px) and (max-width: 1600px) { body { background: limegreen; } }
@media (min-width: 1601px) { body { background: seagreen; } }

Testing can be done with browser developer tools. Key points: max-width targets up to a width, min-width from a width upwards, and combining both targets a range. Media queries are essential for creating flexible, user-friendly websites across all devices.

## Teaching Method
- Use live browser resizing to demonstrate media query effects.
- Assign tasks to write media queries for different breakpoints.
- Encourage experimentation with min-width and max-width.
- Discuss real-world scenarios for using media queries.
