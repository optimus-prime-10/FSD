# TEACHING ROADMAP
1. Show students a blank HTML file and ask what is missing for a valid web page.
2. Introduce the concept of boilerplate code and its importance.
3. Demonstrate the essential tags: <!DOCTYPE html>, <html>, <head>, <body>.
4. Guide students to build a basic HTML boilerplate from scratch (hands-on).
5. Discuss the purpose of meta tags and the <title> element.
6. Review key points and quiz with common interview questions.
7. Offer an extra challenge: add language attributes and extra meta tags for SEO or responsiveness.

# HTML Boilerplate - Summary

An HTML boilerplate is a starting template for new HTML documents, including essential tags and meta information.

## Example
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>Title</title>
</head>
<body>
  <!-- Content -->
</body>
</html>

## Interview Questions

1. What is the purpose of the <!DOCTYPE html> declaration?
   - It tells the browser to use HTML5.
2. Why should you include <meta charset="UTF-8">?
   - To ensure correct character encoding.
3. What does the viewport meta tag do?
   - Controls layout on mobile browsers for responsive design.
4. Where should the <title> tag be placed?
   - Inside the <head> section.
5. What is the minimum required structure for a valid HTML5 document?
   - <!DOCTYPE html>, <html>, <head>, <body>.


To control layout on mobile browsers for responsive design, you use the viewport meta tag in your HTML’s <head> section. This tag tells the browser how to adjust the page’s dimensions and scaling to fit the device’s screen.
Example:
>
How it works:
width=device-width sets the page width to match the device’s screen width.
initial-scale=1.0 sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded.
Why it matters:
Without this tag, mobile browsers may display your site zoomed out, making it look tiny and not mobile-friendly. With the viewport tag, your layout adapts to different screen sizes, making your site responsive.
Summary:
The viewport meta tag is essential for responsive web design because it ensures your layout scales and fits properly on all devices, especially mobiles and tablets.
