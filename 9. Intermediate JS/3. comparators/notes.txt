COMPARATORS AND EQUALITY

What are Comparators?
Comparators are symbols that compare two values.
They help us test conditions in if-else statements.
Examples: >, <, ===, !==, >=, <=

Types of Comparators:
=== (triple equals): Checks value AND data type
== (double equals): Checks value only, ignores type
!== (not equal): Checks if values are different
> (greater than): Checks if left is bigger
< (less than): Checks if left is smaller
>= (greater or equal): Checks if left is bigger or same
<= (less or equal): Checks if left is smaller or same

Key Difference: === vs ==
Triple equals (===) is stricter:
- Checks both value and data type
- Recommended for most cases

Double equals (==) is looser:
- Checks value only
- Ignores data type differences

Example - Type Checking:
let a = 1;        // number
let b = "1";      // string

if (a === b) {
    console.log("yes");  // prints "no"
} else {
    console.log("no");   // because types don't match
}

if (a == b) {
    console.log("yes");  // prints "yes"
} else {
    console.log("no");   // because values are same
}

Real-World Application:
Love Calculator with Ranges:
- Score 1-30: "Low score"
- Score 31-70: "Medium score"  
- Score 71-100: "High score"

This requires combining comparators:
if (score >= 1 && score <= 30) {
    // low range
} else if (score > 30 && score <= 70) {
    // medium range
} else if (score > 70 && score <= 100) {
    // high range
}

Best Practices:
- Use === for equality (safer)
- Use == only when you need type conversion
- Test your comparisons thoroughly
- Use parentheses for complex conditions
