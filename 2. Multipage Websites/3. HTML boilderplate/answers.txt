1. An HTML boilerplate is a standard starting structure for HTML documents. It ensures all necessary elements are present for browser compatibility and best practices.
2. The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration tells the browser to use HTML5 standards for rendering the page.
3. The <meta charset="UTF-8"> tag ensures the document uses UTF-8 character encoding, supporting a wide range of characters.
4. The <head> section contains metadata, links to stylesheets, and other information not visible on the page.
5. In VS Code, you can type '!' and press Enter to quickly generate boilerplate code in a new HTML file.
6. Best practices include using proper indentation, including meta tags, setting the language attribute, and removing deprecated tags.
7. If you forget the boilerplate structure, your HTML page may not render correctly or may have compatibility issues.
