1. Web hosting makes your website accessible on the Internet for anyone to view.
2. Steps: create a GitHub repository, upload files, enable GitHub Pages, and access the live site.
3. The repository must be public so GitHub Pages can serve the files to anyone.
4. index.html is the default file loaded for a directory; it must be present for the site to work.
5. Add a custom 404 page by creating 404.html; it helps users navigate if they visit a broken link.
6. GitHub Pages is free, easy to use, and provides a professional web address for your site.
7. After deploying, check that all links work, images display, and the site loads as expected.
