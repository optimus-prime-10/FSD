3. Relative paths are important for portability and to ensure links work if the project is moved.
4. Add a project screenshot using the <img> tag with the src attribute pointing to the image file.
5. About Me and Contact Me pages provide personal and contact information for visitors or employers.
6. Improve accessibility by using semantic HTML, alt text for images, and ensuring keyboard navigation.
