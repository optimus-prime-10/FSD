1. A multi-page website consists of multiple HTML files, each representing a different page. A single-page website has all content on one page, often using JavaScript to show/hide sections.
2. Organize files with a main index.html, a public/ folder for extra pages, and an assets/ folder for images and resources.
3. Use anchor tags (<a href="path/to/page.html">) to link between pages. Navigation bars help users move between sections.
4. Relative paths ensure links work even if the project is moved to a different location or server.
5. Use an <a> tag wrapping an <img> tag, e.g., <a href="about.html"><img src="cat.png" alt="cat"></a>.
6. Place the same navigation bar on every page, highlight the current page, and use clear, descriptive link text.
7. Test all links after moving the project, use consistent folder and file names, and prefer relative paths for portability.
