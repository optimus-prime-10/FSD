# Mondrian Painting Project - CSS Grid Masterpiece

## Introduction to Piet Mondrian
Piet Mondrian, a renowned Dutch painter, is introduced as someone who would have absolutely loved CSS Grid due to his artistic style. His famous work "Composition No. III with Red, Blue, Yellow and Black" serves as the inspiration for this project. This particular piece was auctioned for an astounding 50.6 million dollars, highlighting the value and beauty of grid-based artistic compositions.

Mondrian's work is characterized by its geometric precision and use of primary colors arranged in grid-like patterns, making it perfect for CSS Grid implementation. His compositions range from simple to extremely complex, offering various options for students to choose from.

## Project Overview
The project involves recreating one of Mondrian's grid-based paintings using CSS Grid. The instructor has provided detailed measurements of the original painting's dimensions, ensuring a pixel-perfect recreation. Students are given the flexibility to either:
- Use the provided measurements and colors for an exact replica
- Choose a different Mondrian composition from Google Image Search
- Create multiple variations of different paintings

The starting files include an index.html with hex color codes matching the original painting's palette, allowing for realistic color reproduction. The goal is to create a centered, pixel-perfect recreation that matches the original artwork's proportions and colors.

## Technical Implementation Approach

### HTML Structure
The solution requires creating multiple div elements - one for each colored square in the painting. In the provided example, there are nine divs total, with some receiving specific classes for different colors while others remain white (the default background).

### CSS Grid Container Setup
The main container uses:
- `display: grid` to establish the grid layout
- Specific height and width based on the measured dimensions
- A background color that shows through gaps to create the appearance of grid lines
- A 9px gap between grid items to simulate the black lines in the original painting

### Grid Track Configuration
The layout consists of:
- Four columns with specific fixed widths based on the painting's proportions
- Four rows with precise height measurements
- Some grid items span multiple columns or rows to create larger blocks

### Item Positioning Techniques
Various CSS Grid properties are used for positioning:
- `grid-column: span 2` or `grid-column: span 3` for items that span multiple columns
- `grid-row: span 2` for items that span multiple rows vertically
- `grid-area` for more complex positioning scenarios
- Default white background for most items, with specific colors applied to colored blocks

### Centering the Artwork
The entire grid container is centered on the screen using Flexbox techniques, demonstrating how Grid and Flexbox can work together effectively.

## Solution Code Structure
The final solution includes:
- A container div with grid display properties
- Nine individual div elements representing each square in the painting
- CSS classes for different colors (red, blue, yellow)
- Precise grid track sizing using fixed measurements
- Strategic use of grid spanning properties for larger blocks
- Gap properties to create the appearance of grid lines

## Key Learning Objectives
This project reinforces several important CSS Grid concepts:
1. **Grid Track Sizing**: Understanding how to size columns and rows precisely
2. **Item Positioning**: Using grid-column, grid-row, and grid-area properties
3. **Spanning Elements**: Creating items that span multiple grid tracks
4. **Gap Management**: Using gaps to create visual separation between grid items
5. **Combining Layout Methods**: Using Flexbox for centering and Grid for the main layout

## Creative Flexibility
Students are encouraged to experiment with different Mondrian compositions, allowing them to:
- Practice visual estimation of grid proportions
- Choose between simple and complex compositions
- Develop their own artistic interpretations
- Create multiple variations to strengthen their understanding

## Reflection and Mastery
This project serves as a comprehensive test of CSS Grid knowledge, requiring students to:
- Plan the grid structure before implementation
- Calculate precise measurements and proportions
- Apply multiple CSS Grid properties effectively
- Combine Grid with other layout methods like Flexbox
- Create visually appealing, pixel-perfect layouts

The project demonstrates that CSS Grid is not just a practical layout tool but can also be used for artistic expression and creative design, bridging the gap between technical web development and artistic composition.

## Final Outcome
The completed project results in a beautiful, centered recreation of a Mondrian painting that showcases the power and precision of CSS Grid. The final artwork demonstrates how web technologies can be used to create sophisticated, visually striking layouts that rival traditional artistic mediums.
